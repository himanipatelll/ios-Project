I would like to create an app that allows users to manage their finances, particularly helping them achieve their savings goal. This app would feature personalized budget planning (determined upon amount and time), savings advisor, progress tracking, and weekly/monthly reports. 

## Notes
While building this app I ran to errors such as the buttons performing the action of the other button and the build failing due to multiple Info.plist files
